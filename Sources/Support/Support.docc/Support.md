# ``Support``

A collection of commonly used supporting code.

## Overview

`Support` is a lightweight package provides functionality that often is needed in different projects.

The framework is effectively a collection of “micro frameworks”, each of which focused on a specific concern like networking. The various sub-parts of the library are intentionally lightly coupled, to make it easy to just “extract” the necessary functionality and make it available as either a separate package, or just directly embed in a project.
